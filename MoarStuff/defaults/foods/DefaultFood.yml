#               *** CRAFTING ***
# If it is shapeless, just add the ingredient ids int here. for example:
# ingredients:
# - 02 
# - 07
#
# For shaped, ingredients is a bit more confusing.
# Each number represents a possible spot in the recipe. 
# Next to the number, after the semicolon, add the item id which it represents
# For example:
# 1: 2 
# We just made it so that '1' represents 2 or 'grass'. 
# When we call it in our shape, it will represent grass in the crafting table spot.
# The numbers are ordered like so: 
# TOP LEFT, TOP MIDDLE, TOP RIGHT, MIDDLE LEFT, MIDDLE MIDDLE, MIDDLE RIGHT, BOTTOM LEFT, BOTTOM MIDDLE, BOTTOM RIGHT
# **warning** - if you want to use air, leave the ingredient spot blank

#           *** EFFECTS ***
#
# This is one of the most tricky parts of this whole plugin. If you mess anything up here, it may cause errors
# or maybe even server crashes. But don't worry, it's pretty simple if you can understand english. If not,
# post on plugin page asking for help, or maybe help me translate? :D
#
# Bows only have the option to check when the bow fires, or when the arrow from the bow hits.
